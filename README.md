## Contributing Additions

If you have additions, please make sure they meet the definition above. These are predominately focused on "western values", which you can interperete however you feel :)

You can also just append to the `slur.Checkers` global var to add your own definitions, or outright replace the existing ones. This is not
threadsafe, so make sure to define everything you want to use ahead of time.
